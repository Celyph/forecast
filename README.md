# Weather Forecast

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a weather forecast page for any given city.
- I built this project to further understand how to use server side APIs.
- This code is effective in showing the weather for an area via user input.
- Composing this weather app, I learned how to maneuver different errors to utilize an API.
